Setting and meeting benchmarks are the crux of that approach. We will plan with documentation and processes geared at ensuring your deliverable will be accepted once the project is concluded. The <a href ="https://www.pmi.org/"> Project Managment Institute</a> is a trans-national organization that has set standards and protocols for making that happen and we take it very seriously. This means clearly outlining a project management plan that will detail our process step by step.  </p>

                            <p className="lead text-muted font-w-5"> There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to project management. It is recognized and agreed upon by experts that when we discuss "project management" we're referring to a stand-alone project. Many businesses conflate operations and project management and for that reason may end up over budget and off-schedule. What we provide is the opportunity to launch a project with us using a tried and true project management methodology, or you can opt for adhoc private (phone or video) consultation(s). The latter will be priced depending on the scope of your inquiry, time-limitations, and any work that has to be done on our end. If you start a project with us  we will be in constant contact and we will happily explain the processes that we employ.  With our consulting services we want to help you out of a jam and to ensure your project looks and feels right. Contact us for more information.  </p>
